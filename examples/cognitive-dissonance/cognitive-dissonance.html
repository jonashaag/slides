  <h1>Cognitive Dissonance</h1>
  <h2 class=subtitle>One of the most extensively studied theories in social psychology, confirmed in hundreds of experiments</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>History</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Leon Festinger (social psychologist in NY) infiltrated (Observation by Participation) an UFO sect in the 1950s
    <li>the sect expected the end of the world by a certain date
    <li>the prediction failed, but the members started to evangelize other people instead of breaking up
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Cognitive Dissonance</h1>
  <p>Sect members had two contradicting cognitions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“According to our believes, the world should have ended yesterday”
    <li>“The world still exists”
  </ul>
  <p>These people had cognitive dissonance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Cognitive Dissonance in General</h1>
  <p>An uncomfortable feeling caused by multiple dissonant cognitions, e.g. if</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your behaviour does not match your moral concepts
    <li>you made a decision and there were other comparable alternatives
    <li>you made a wrong decision
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Resolving Cognitive Dissonance</h1>
  <h2>Strategy 1: Change one cognition to match the other</h2>
  <p>Change behaviour to match values (unlikely) or change values to match behaviour (more likely)</p>
  <h2>Strategy 2: Downplay the dissonance</h2>
  <p>Disappointed after note issue: “10/15 pts suffice”</p>
  <h2>Strategy 3: Involve external excuses</h2>
  <p>“I was forced to act/everybody acts this way”</p>

  <h1>The Fox and the Grapes</h1>
  <figure>
    <img src=the-fox-and-the-grapes.jpg />
    <figcaption>a fox wants to eat up some grapes he can not reach</figcaption>
  </figure>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>The Fox and the Grapes</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>the Fox has two clashing cognitions: <blockquote>I want to eat those grapes</blockquote> and <blockquote>I can not reach them</blockquote>
    <li>to resolve the dissonance, the Fox choses strategy 1 by changing the first cognition: “The grapes are not ripe yet anyway”
    <li>The Fox and the Grapes is a fable, so this has to be considered metaphorical
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Dissonance After Placing a Bet</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Bettors (horse race) were asked to rate the horse the selected immediately before and after placing the bet
    <li>they rated their horse 50% better than before the bet (on a scale from 1 to 7)
    <li>strategy 1
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Benjamin Franklin Effect</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>B.J. asked a political opponent the favor of borrowing him a book (by post)
    <li>opponent sent him the book
    <li>next time they met he talked gently to B.J. for the first time and they became friends
    <li>opponent had cognitive dissonance (“I don't like B.J.” vs. “I did him a favor”)
    <li>strategy 1
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Deficient Reward Paradigm</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>probands spent an hour on very boring activities
    <li>then they were asked to suggest other people that the task was very interesting
    <li>some of them were paid $7, others $150
    <li>the $7 group rated the task as much more interesting than the $150 group
    <li>strategy 1 ↔ strategy 3
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Deficient Punishment Paradigm</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>children (kindergarden) were forbidden to play with their favorite toy
    <li>half the children were threatened with severe, the other half with mild punishment
    <li>the severe punishment group continued to use their favorite toys after the experiment
    <li>the other half did not
    <li>strategy 1 ↔ strategy 3
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Hand-Washing Reduces Post-Decisional Cognitive Dissonance</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>probands chose between one of two CDs (they like both)
    <li>half the probands washed their hands after the choice
    <li>the other half rated the selected CD much higher(strategy 1) than the hand-washing group
    <li>conclusion: hand-washing reduces post-decisional cognitive dissonance
  </ul>
